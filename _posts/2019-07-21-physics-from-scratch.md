Physics classes were among my favorite back in secondary school and CEGEP. Now that I am studying software engineering at university, I don't get to do a lot of physics. Yet, I still want to learn about the universe and how it works. 

For some years, I wanted to reinvent physics. To use modern tools to rediscover physical laws. I could use computer vision to track moving objects, plot the motions in a Jupyter Notebook and deduce the laws of motions.
