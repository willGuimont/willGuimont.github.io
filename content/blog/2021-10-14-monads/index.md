Instead of doing like everyone else and write a long-winded blog post about my `aha moment` about monads, I'll only link some useful resources about monads.

- [Cuddly, Octo-Palm Tree's series on monads](https://cuddly-octo-palm-tree.com/posts/2021-04-11-monads-0/)
- [Functors and Monads For People Who Have Read Too Many "Tutorials"](http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2958)
