In many robotics projects, AprilTags are indispensable. But the standard approach — printing on paper, gluing to cardboard — doesn’t hold up outside the lab.
Tags peel, warp, fade, and disintegrate when exposed to handling, humidity, or rough environments.

`Tracker3D.jl` solves this.
It generates 3D-printable AprilTags engineered for the real world: flat, durable, weather-resistant, and easy to integrate directly into enclosures or mounts.
Whether you’re field-testing robots or deploying long-term vision systems, these tags won’t fail you.

Why `Tracker3D.jl`?
- 🚫 No more flimsy paper or fragile adhesives
- ✅ Always flat, robust, and easy to embed
- ☁️ Weatherproof and reusable
- 🧩 Ideal for industrial, outdoor, or educational setups
