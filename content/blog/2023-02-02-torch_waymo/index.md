Here's a small library I made to use the [Waymo Open Dataset](https://waymo.com/open/) in PyTorch, without any dependency to Tensorflow: [willGuimont/torch_waymo](https://github.com/willGuimont/torch_waymo).

Here's the corresponding PyPI package: [torch-waymo](https://pypi.org/project/torch-waymo/).
