Here's a small library I made to explain the Transformer architecture in PyTorch: <a class="external" href="https://github.com/willGuimont/transformers" target="_blank">willGuimont/transformers</a>.
The code is heavily commented and should be easy to follow.

This repository also contains some popular transformer-based models, such as Vision Transformer.

This was made while developping new practical exercises for <a class="external" href="https://github.com/ulaval-damas/glo4030-labs" target="_blank">GLO-7030 at Universit√© Laval</a>.
