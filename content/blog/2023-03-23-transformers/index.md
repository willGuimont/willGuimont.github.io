Here's a small library I made to explain the Transformer architecture in PyTorch: <a class="external" href="https://github.com/willGuimont/transformers" target="_blank">willGuimont/transformers</a>.
The code is heavily commented and should be easy to follow.

This repository also contains some popular transformer-based models, such as Vision Transformer.
