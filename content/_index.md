# `wigum::intro`


Welcome --- I'm William Guimont-Martin (`wigum`). I am a Ph.D. student in robotics and artificial intelligence, working at the intersection of computer vision and robotics. My research focuses on how we can use additional modalities --- such as hyperspectral, polar, or LiDAR data --- as scaffolding during training to help models learn more robust and generalizable representations.

This website serves as a space to share my work, ideas, and projects --- whether they are scientific, technical, or creative. You will find research notes, blog posts, and resources that reflect both my academic path and broader interests in computer science, machine learning, and beyond.

Check out the latest posts in the [blog](@/blog/_index.md), or connect with me on the wider internet through the links in the navigation bar.
