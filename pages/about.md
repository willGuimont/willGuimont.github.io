This is my personal website where I share my projects and research.
I am currently a Ph.D. student at Université Laval in the [Northern Robotics Laboratory (Norlab)](https://norlab.ulaval.ca/people/w_guimont-martin/).
I mostly work on applying deep learning techniques in innovative ways to solve problems in mobile robotics and autonomous systems.
In addition to my research, I am a teaching assistant at Université Laval for graduate-level courses: [GLO-7030: Apprentissage par réseaux de neurones profonds](https://www.ulaval.ca/etudes/cours/glo-7030-apprentissage-par-reseaux-de-neurones-profonds) and [GLO-7021: Introduction à la robotique mobile](https://www.ulaval.ca/etudes/cours/glo-7021-introduction-a-la-robotique-mobile).
I am also a Candidate to the engineering profession (CEP) in Canada and an [inventor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=sZIyj3IAAAAJ&citation_for_view=sZIyj3IAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC).

## Education
- Ph.D. in Computer Science, Deep learning and mobile robotics @ [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/) (2023-...) 
- Master's Degree in Computer Science, Research in Deep Learning and 3D sensors for autonomous vehicules @ [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/) (2021-2023) 
- Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering, distinction profile @ [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/) (2017-2021)

## Implication

Since 2016, I've been mentoring secondary school students in a [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team, Les Chevaliers 5440 from École secondaire de la Seigneurie.
I teach them about programming, electronics, and robotics, and I help them build a robot to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition.
